# Salary Data Visualization Project (Tableau)

This repository contains a series of Tableau dashboards created as part of my personal learning journey during the course **Data Visualization and Communication with Tableau**, offered by Duke University via Coursera.

## Project Purpose

The goal of this project is to explore salary data across job titles, visa categories, and U.S. states using Tableau. It serves as a hands-on exercise in building visualizations, interpreting patterns, and communicating insights through charts.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project was provided by the course and downloaded from the official Coursera platform.  
It includes anonymized salary records and metadata such as job title subgroup, visa class, and state location.

## Dashboard Highlights

- **Job_Title_Vs_Median_Paid_Wage_Per_Year**  
  Visualizes wage disparities across professions, showing attorneys and data scientists at the top end, and teachers at the lower end.

- **Analyzing_Salary_Data_by_Visa_Category**  
  Compares median wages across visa types and job roles, revealing how visa status may influence compensation.

- **Grouping_Salaries_in_Different_States_By_Job_Subgroup**  
  Displays regional salary differences across U.S. states, with a focus on data scientists and data analysts.
